              This section has been prepared by the Department of Civil Engineering this section records all of the requirements associated with earning the
              degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering at the University of Abuja. The degree
              Programme is administered by the Department of Civil Engineering. This section also
              contains other useful information related to studying civil engineering, being a student in our
              department. The Handbook is revised regularly to reflect changes in requirements and other
              relevant information. The civil engineering curriculum committee works regularly to improve
              the curriculum that we offer to you.
              If you have any problems, concerns, or suggestions related to the Handbook or, more generally,
              the undergraduate Programme in Civil Engineering, please bring them to my attention. Good
              luck in your studies.
